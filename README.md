> Current Version 1.1

CHANGELOG:

---------------------------------------------------
v1.1

--changes from v1.0--

-atom nodes now have a 'parent', does nothing yet but will be
implemented to rendering soon

-'smart rendering', larger chemicals have a simpler
render structure, as opposed to the full render, eg.


H-0-H  --would render as--> H20

-a more advanced protein building system, now accpects
amino acid instruction sets

-atoms now have a unique ID, composed of a molecule ID, and
an atom id, eg atom 2.15 is atom 15, of group 2

-molecule can no longer bond and incorperate two atoms
from the outside via bonding, molecules can only
gain atoms from being bonded to

-error fixing in the 'Experiment' class

-more module tests in 'Chem'
